LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API. It
requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

LLFUSE was originally part of S3QL, but has been factored out so that
it can be used by other projects as well.

The SlackBuild detects presence of Python 3.x and if found, then also
bindings for Python 3.x are built.

This is a modified slackbuild for a newer version of llfuse than available
on SlackBuilds.org.  Original maintainer information maintained although
they did not do this update.  Updated by shinji257
