Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and 
anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called 
"Terminal Multiplexers".

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice 
simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the 
box as well as the advanced features it places at its users' fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep 
customizability, personal automation through layouts, true multiplayer 
collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, 
and a plugin system allowing one to create plugins in any language that 
compiles to WebAssembly.
