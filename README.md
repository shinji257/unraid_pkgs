|aria2|||1.37.0|aria2 is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source, cross platform download utility operated in command-line.<br>It supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent and Metalink.
|audit|||3.0.7|The Linux Auditing System is a kernel subsystem the allows the kernel to record events of interest to intrusion detection systems, such as file access attempts, specific system calls, or custom events generated by trusted system binaries like login or sshd. The audit package provides the tools to configure the audit system, and to collect and process its output.<br><br>To collect audit events, your kernel must have the audit system enabled, which is present in the stock Slackware kernels.<br><br>The audit package has no other dependencies. However, certain audit events of interest, such as failed login attempts from /bin/login, password changes, etcetera are generated by their respective binaries using libaudit. If your site policy requires auditing those events, some reconfiguration and/or patching may be required.

|exiftool|||13.00|ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl library (Image::ExifTool) plus a command-line application (exiftool) for reading, writing, and editing meta information in image, audio, and video files.<br><br>ExifTool supports many different types of metadata including EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP, ID3, and Lyrics3, as well as the maker notes of many digital cameras.
|fdupes|||1.6.1|FDUPES is a program for identifying or deleting duplicate files residing within specified directories.
|fio|||3.38|fio is a tool that will spawn a number of threads or processes doing a particular type of io action as specified by the user. fio takes a number of global parameters, each inherited by the thread unless otherwise parameters given to them overriding that setting is given. The typical use of fio is to write a job file matching the io load one wants to simulate.
|fish|||3.7.1|fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)<br><br>fish is a user friendly command line shell for UNIX-like systems.  fish includes case insensitive completions, a multiline editing system, a new and simplified key binding system, and a large number of command specific completions.

|iotop|||0.6|iotop is a Python program with a top-like UI used to show of behalf of which process is the I/O going on.
|iotop-c|||1.26|iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output requests on your machine.<br>It is similar to the well known top utility, but instead of showing you what consumes CPU the most, it lists processes by their IO usage. Inspired by iotop Python script from Guillaume Chazarain, rewritten in C by Vyacheslav Trushkin and improved by Boian Bonev so it runs without Python at all.<br><br>Note that this conflicts with iotop (install one of the two).
|ipmitool|||1.8.18|IPMItool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) version 1.5 and version 2.0 specifications.  It features the ability to read the sensor data repository (SDR) and print sensor values, display the contents of the System Event Log (SEL), print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory information, read and set LAN configuration parameters, and perform remote chassis power control.
